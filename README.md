### **What is DevTools?**

DevTools (Developer Tools) are built-in tools in modern web browsers that help developers inspect, debug, and optimize web pages or applications. They provide real-time insights into the structure, behavior, and performance of websites.

### **Why Do We Use DevTools?**

- **Debugging**: Identify and fix issues in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Testing**: Simulate different screen sizes, devices, and network conditions.
- **Optimization**: Analyze page performance and reduce load times.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure websites meet accessibility standards.
- **Live Editing**: Make real-time changes to code for rapid prototyping.

### **What Tools Did Developers Use Before Browser DevTools?**

Before browser DevTools became mainstream, developers relied on external tools and techniques like:

1. **Firebug (for Firefox)**: A popular third-party extension for inspecting and debugging web pages.
2. **View Source**: Manually checking the pageâ€™s source code using the browser's "View Source" feature.
3. **Console Logging**: Using `alert()` or `console.log()` for debugging JavaScript.
4. **Text Editors/IDEs**: Developers would modify files locally and then reload the browser to see changes.
5. **Network Tools**: Standalone tools like Wireshark or Fiddler for analyzing network requests.
