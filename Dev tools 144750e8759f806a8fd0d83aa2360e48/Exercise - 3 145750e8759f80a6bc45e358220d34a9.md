# Exercise - 3

# Debugging

The area below is supposed to be a list of interesting facts about cats! If you look at the HTML you'll see the following:

```html
<ul id="catfacts"></ul>
```

And a file in this repo `/public/exercises/js/Debugging.js` is hitting an API and supposed to populate that list! Can you figure out what's going wrong?

Hint: Checking the console is a great place to start. Once you've identified the area, use the debugger in the Sources tab to get a lay of the land.

    4. Navigate to Sources and resolve the undefined value
    5. Set breakpoints at:
    `li.innerText = inner.fact`
    6. Open the Watch panel and enter "li"
