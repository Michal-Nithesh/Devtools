# Debugging

For demonstration purposes, we're just logging in the background with an interval. Click on the `Debugging.js`  file.

If you click on a function, it will turn blue, indicating that a Breakpoints is set. Once the Breakpoints is created, you won't see any more console logs here.

- Set and activate breakpoints
- Use the `debugger` keyword
- Walk the call stack
- Set conditional breakpoints
- Set XHR breakpoints
